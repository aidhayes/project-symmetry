   This is a basic outline for implementing test-driven development (TDD) for the functions in Project-Symmetry project. 
Please keep in mind that for a complete test suite, we would need to cover a variety of test cases including 
edge cases. 
   When developing a test suite, it’s important to consider different scenarios and inputs that your functions might 
encounter. This includes not only typical or expected inputs but also “special cases, boundary conditions, and invalid 
inputs.” 
    These scenarios are often referred to as test cases, and they help ensure that our functions behave correctly 
and robustly under a variety of conditions. Let's break down the statement “variety of test cases, including edge cases 
as well special cases:”

1.	Variety of Test Cases
    o	Positive Cases: Test the functions with typical or expected inputs [valid or normal wikipedia link: Article] to 
    ensure they produce the correct output.
    o	Negative Cases: Test the functions with invalid or unexpected inputs[invalid or anormal Wiki link: Article] to 
    ensure they handle errors gracefully, for example, by raising appropriate exceptions or returning meaningful error messages.

2.	Edge Cases
    o	Boundary Conditions: Test the functions with inputs at the boundaries of valid ranges or limits. For example, 
    if your function processes lists, test it with an empty list or a list with one element.
    o	Extreme Values: Test the functions with extreme values or inputs that might cause performance issues or unexpected 
    behavior. This is crucial for functions dealing with numeric calculations or large datasets.

3.	Special Cases
    o	Corner Cases: Test the functions with inputs that might be considered unusual[A non-wikipedia link: Article] or on the 
    edge of typical usage.
    o	Specific Conditions: If your functions have specific conditions or constraints [A very large or huge Wiki link 
    (<4500 words): Article], create test cases to ensure those conditions are handled correctly.

    To conclude, by covering a variety of test cases, including these different scenarios, we increase the likelihood of catching 
bugs or issues that might not be apparent with only typical inputs. This comprehensive testing approach helps ensure that your 
functions are reliable, robust, and can handle a wide range of situations they might encounter in real-world usage.
